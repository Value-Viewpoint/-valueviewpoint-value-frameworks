# Agentic AI – Value Engineering Framework

This document defines a **value engineering framework** for evaluating
agentic AI initiatives in enterprise environments.

It focuses on **economic impact and finance validation**, not model
architecture or technical implementation.

All assumptions are illustrative and must be validated
with customer-specific data.

---

## 1. Business Context

Agentic AI systems are designed to:
- Execute multi-step tasks autonomously
- Coordinate actions across systems
- Reduce human intervention in operational workflows

Their value depends not on intelligence alone,
but on **measurable changes to cost, speed, quality, and risk**.

---

## 2. Agentic Roles in Business Processes

Agentic AI typically plays one or more roles:

- **Assist** – supports human decision-making
- **Decide** – recommends or selects actions
- **Act** – executes actions autonomously

Each role carries different value potential
and different risk and confidence considerations.

---

## 3. Primary Value Driver Categories

### 3.1 Labor Productivity
- Reduction in manual effort
- Increased throughput per employee
- Shift from low-value to high-value work

### 3.2 Cycle Time Reduction
- Faster case resolution
- Reduced handoffs and wait times
- Improved responsiveness

### 3.3 Quality and Error Reduction
- Fewer mistakes and rework
- Improved consistency of execution
- Reduced exception handling

### 3.4 Cost Avoidance
- Avoided external services
- Deferred hiring
- Reduced overtime and backlogs

### 3.5 Risk and Control
- Policy-compliant execution
- Auditability of actions
- Reduced operational and compliance risk

---

## 4. Baseline vs. Target State Logic

### Baseline
- Human-driven workflows
- Manual coordination across systems
- High variability in outcomes
- Limited scalability

### Target State
- Agent-assisted or agent-executed workflows
- Automated orchestration
- Predictable execution patterns
- Scalable operations

## 5. Value Calculation Approach

Value estimation typically includes:

1. Identification of impacted processes
2. Baseline measurement (volume, time, cost, error rates)
3. Definition of agentic role and scope
4. Calculation of annualized economic impact
5. Adjustment for confidence and adoption risk

Calculations must be transparent and finance-traceable.

---

## 6. Cost and Investment Considerations

Include all relevant costs:
- Model development or licensing
- Infrastructure and runtime
- Monitoring and governance
- Change management and training

Net value must reflect **total cost of ownership**.

---

## 7. Confidence and Sensitivity

Agentic AI value is sensitive to:
- Adoption and trust
- Exception handling rates
- Governance maturity

Use conservative assumptions and
scenario-based sensitivity analysis.

---

## 8. Finance Validation Checklist

Before approval, confirm:
- Clear linkage between agents and process outcomes
- Conservative benefit assumptions
- Explicit treatment of risk and control
- Full cost visibility
- Alignment with finance reporting structures

---

## 9. Disclaimer

This framework defines **economic structure**, not guaranteed results.
Actual outcomes depend on execution quality,
governance, and organizational readiness.
