# AI & Agentic Systems – Value Engineering Frameworks

This folder contains **open value engineering frameworks** for assessing the
economic impact of AI-enabled and agentic systems in enterprise environments.

The focus is on **business value justification**, not model performance,
architecture design, or vendor-specific capabilities.

---

## Scope of Frameworks

The frameworks here support value assessment for initiatives such as:

- Agentic AI and autonomous workflows
- Intelligent automation and augmentation
- Decision support systems
- AI-enabled shared services and operations
- AI applied to sales, finance, HR, IT, and customer operations

All examples are **synthetic** and intended for illustration only.

## Core Value Principles for AI

AI initiatives are evaluated using a small number of repeatable value patterns:

### 1. Automation vs. Augmentation
- **Automation:** tasks fully removed from human execution
- **Augmentation:** human productivity, quality, or throughput improvement

Both patterns require different economic logic and confidence treatment.

### 2. Primary Value Sources
Typical AI value drivers include:
- Cycle time reduction
- Labor productivity gains
- Error and rework reduction
- Throughput increase
- Risk exposure reduction
- Avoided external spend

### 3. Cost and Risk Considerations
AI value assessments must explicitly account for:
- Model development or licensing costs
- Infrastructure and runtime costs
- Governance, compliance, and monitoring effort
- Change management and adoption risk
- Accuracy, hallucination, and control mechanisms

## How to Use These Frameworks

Each framework typically includes:
1. Business problem definition
2. AI role in the process (assist, decide, act)
3. Baseline vs. target performance
4. Inputs required for value calculation
5. Explicit calculation logic
6. Confidence levels and sensitivity ranges
7. Finance validation checklist

These frameworks are designed to be:
- Reviewed with finance and operations stakeholders
- Adapted to specific organizational contexts
- Used as input to formal investment decisions

## What This Is NOT

- ❌ AI model benchmarks or performance metrics
- ❌ Technical architecture or implementation guides
- ❌ Vendor-specific ROI claims
- ❌ Guaranteed outcome projections

This repository focuses on **economic reasoning**, not technical execution.

---

## Current Frameworks (in progress)

- Agentic AI ROI logic
- Automation vs. augmentation decision model
- Risk-adjusted AI value assessment patterns

## Disclaimer

AI value realization is highly dependent on adoption, governance,
and process change. All assumptions and calculations must be validated
with customer-specific data and finance stakeholders before use.
