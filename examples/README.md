# Worked Value Engineering Examples

This folder contains **worked, end-to-end examples** that demonstrate how
value engineering frameworks and schemas are applied in practice.

All examples are **synthetic**, simplified, and designed for learning,
discussion, and validation purposes.

---

## Purpose of These Examples

These examples are intended to:

- Make value engineering tangible and explainable
- Show how abstract frameworks translate into numbers
- Illustrate baseline → target → economic impact logic
- Support stakeholder discussions with finance and operations
- Help teams avoid black-box ROI calculations

They are **not** intended to represent final investment cases.

## What Each Example Includes

Each worked example typically follows the same structure:

1. **Business context**
   - Industry, function, and scope (genericized)

2. **Problem statement**
   - What is inefficient, slow, risky, or costly today

3. **Baseline assumptions**
   - Current performance metrics
   - Volumes, frequencies, and unit costs

4. **Target state assumptions**
   - Expected improvements enabled by change

5. **Value driver breakdown**
   - Explicit value drivers and formulas
   - Traceable links to baseline and deltas

6. **Economic impact summary**
   - Annualized benefit view
   - Conservative assumptions by default

7. **Confidence and sensitivity notes**
   - What could vary
   - What finance would challenge

## Example Categories (in progress)

- SAP Clean Core transformation example
- S/4HANA business case illustration
- Agentic AI value assessment example
- Automation vs. augmentation comparison

Each example references the schemas defined in `/schemas`
and the conceptual frameworks in `/sap` and `/ai`.

## How to Use These Examples

These examples can be used to:
- Educate stakeholders unfamiliar with value engineering
- Align business, IT, and finance perspectives
- Train partners and internal teams
- Serve as starting points for customer-specific analyses

They should always be adapted and validated
with organization-specific data.

## Disclaimer

These examples are illustrative only.
Actual business cases require customer-specific inputs,
validated assumptions, and finance approval.
