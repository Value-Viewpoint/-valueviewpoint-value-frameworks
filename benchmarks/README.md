# Benchmark Guidance

This folder provides **guidance on using benchmarks responsibly**
in enterprise value engineering and business case development.

The intent is to support **assumption validation**, not to provide
definitive or proprietary benchmark data.

## Role of Benchmarks in Value Engineering

Benchmarks are used to:
- Validate the plausibility of assumptions
- Establish reasonable baseline and target ranges
- Support sensitivity analysis and scenario planning
- Enable finance and stakeholder discussions

Benchmarks should **inform**, not replace, customer-specific data.

---

## Benchmark Usage Principles

All benchmarks referenced or implied in this repository follow these principles:

1. **Directional, not deterministic**
   - Benchmarks indicate typical ranges, not guaranteed outcomes

2. **Context-dependent**
   - Industry, scale, geography, maturity, and process design matter

3. **Finance-challengable**
   - Benchmarks must withstand scrutiny from finance stakeholders

4. **Replaceable**
   - Customer-provided data always supersedes external benchmarks

---

## Common Benchmark Categories

Benchmarks are typically used for:

- Process cycle times
- Labor productivity ranges
- Error and rework rates
- Automation potential
- Cost-to-serve indicators
- Adoption and realization curves

These categories are applied conservatively by default.

## Sources of Benchmark Insight

Benchmark ranges may be informed by:
- Public research and industry studies
- Analyst publications
- Academic and practitioner literature
- Aggregated, anonymized experience
- Customer-provided operational data

No proprietary or confidential data is included in this repository.

## How Benchmarks Are Applied

Benchmarks are typically used to:
- Set **low / base / high** assumption ranges
- Support sensitivity analysis
- Highlight areas requiring deeper customer validation
- Identify outliers that warrant investigation

They should never be used as a substitute for
customer-specific measurement and validation.

## Disclaimer

Benchmarks are illustrative and contextual.
All assumptions must be validated with customer data
and approved by finance stakeholders before use
in any investment decision.
