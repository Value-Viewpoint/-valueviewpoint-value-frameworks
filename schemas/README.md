# Value Engineering Schemas

This folder defines **open, reusable schemas** for structuring value drivers,
assumptions, and economic calculations used in enterprise business cases.

The purpose of these schemas is to make value logic:
- Explicit
- Auditable
- Comparable
- Reusable across industries and initiatives

---

## Why Schemas Matter

Enterprise value discussions often fail because:
- Assumptions are implicit
- Calculations are opaque
- Benefits are described narratively, not structurally
- Finance teams cannot trace numbers to drivers

Schemas solve this by separating:
- **What changes economically**
- **Why it changes**
- **How it is calculated**
- **How confident we are**

---

## Schema Design Principles

All schemas in this folder follow these principles:

1. **Business-first**
   - No technical or implementation fields
   - Focus on economic drivers and outcomes

2. **Tool-agnostic**
   - Can be implemented in spreadsheets, documents, or software
   - Not tied to ValueViewpoint or any specific platform

3. **Finance-traceable**
   - Every output maps to a baseline, delta, and unit cost
   - Assumptions are explicitly documented

4. **Confidence-aware**
   - Each value driver includes confidence and sensitivity guidance
   - Supports conservative, base, and upside scenarios

## Core Schema Types (in progress)

- Value driver schema
- Benefit calculation schema
- Cost and investment schema
- Risk and confidence schema

These schemas are designed to be composed together
to form complete, auditable business cases.

## How to Use These Schemas

Schemas can be used to:
- Standardize value assessments across teams
- Accelerate partner-led value engineering
- Enable consistent finance validation
- Compare initiatives on an economic basis

They are intended to be adapted to specific organizational
standards and governance models.

## Disclaimer

Schemas define **structure**, not results.
All values, assumptions, and calculations must be validated
with customer-specific data and finance stakeholders before use.
