# SAP Value Engineering Frameworks

This folder contains **open, tool-agnostic value engineering frameworks** used to
build CFO-grade business cases for SAP-led transformation programs.

The intent is to make **economic logic explicit, explainable, and reusable**
across SAP practices, GSIs, internal transformation teams, and technology partners.

---

## What This Covers

The frameworks in this folder are designed to support value justification for:

- SAP S/4HANA transformations
- Clean Core initiatives
- SAP BTP–enabled extensions
- Data transformation and analytics programs
- Process standardization and automation initiatives

All examples are **synthetic** and **non-customer-specific**.

---

## How to Use These Frameworks

Each framework typically follows the same structure:

1. **Business problem definition**
2. **Value drivers** (what economically changes)
3. **Baseline vs. target state**
4. **Inputs required from the customer**
5. **Calculation logic** (not black-box math)
6. **Confidence and evidence guidance**
7. **Finance validation checklist**

These assets are intended to be:
- Reviewed with SAP finance and transformation stakeholders
- Adapted to specific customer contexts
- Used as scaffolding for partner-led value assessments

---

## What This Is NOT

- ❌ SAP product documentation
- ❌ Customer benchmarks or proprietary data
- ❌ Final investment recommendations
- ❌ Source code for ValueViewpoint

This repository focuses on **value logic**, not software implementation.

---

## Current Frameworks (in progress)

- Clean Core value model
- S/4HANA transformation business case outline
- Process-level value driver decomposition

Additional frameworks will be added incrementally.

---

## Disclaimer

These frameworks provide **illustrative economic logic only**.
All assumptions, benchmarks, and calculations must be validated
with customer-specific data and finance stakeholders before use
in any investment decision.
