# SAP S/4HANA – Business Case Outline

This document provides a **structured outline** for building a CFO-grade
business case for SAP S/4HANA transformation programs.

It is designed to support joint discussions between business,
IT, and finance stakeholders.

---

## 1. Business Context

SAP S/4HANA programs are typically initiated to address:

- Aging ECC landscapes
- Increasing operational and maintenance costs
- Limited real-time visibility
- Process fragmentation and manual workarounds
- Inability to support digital and AI-enabled processes

The business case must clearly link the transformation
to **measurable economic outcomes**.

## 2. Scope Definition

Clearly define the scope of the S/4HANA initiative:

- Deployment approach (greenfield, brownfield, selective)
- In-scope business units and geographies
- Core processes included (e.g., O2C, P2P, R2R, Plan-to-Produce)
- Integration with surrounding systems

Scope clarity is essential for credible value estimation.
