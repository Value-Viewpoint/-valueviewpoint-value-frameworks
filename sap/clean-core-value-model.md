# SAP Clean Core – Value Engineering Model

This document defines a **value engineering model** for SAP Clean Core initiatives.
It is designed to support **CFO-grade justification** for investments that reduce
customization, improve upgradeability, and enable faster innovation.

All assumptions and examples are illustrative and must be validated
with customer-specific data.

---

## 1. Business Context

Organizations running SAP environments with heavy customizations often face:

- High cost of ownership
- Slow upgrade cycles
- Increased regression and testing effort
- Limited ability to adopt new SAP innovations
- Elevated operational and compliance risk

Clean Core initiatives aim to **separate core ERP stability from business innovation**
by reducing custom code and shifting extensions to supported platforms.

---

## 2. Scope of Clean Core Initiatives

Typical Clean Core programs include:

- Reduction or elimination of custom ABAP code
- Standardization of core SAP processes
- Migration of extensions to SAP BTP or side-by-side architectures
- Improved release and upgrade discipline
- Governance of future customization requests

The value of Clean Core is realized over **multiple dimensions**, not just IT cost.

## 3. Primary Value Driver Categories

### 3.1 IT Cost Reduction
- Lower custom code maintenance effort
- Reduced regression testing costs
- Fewer production incidents related to customizations
- Lower external consulting dependency

### 3.2 Upgrade and Release Efficiency
- Shorter upgrade cycles
- Reduced downtime during upgrades
- Faster adoption of SAP releases and innovations
- Lower upgrade project costs

### 3.3 Business Agility
- Faster implementation of business changes
- Reduced lead time for new functionality
- Improved responsiveness to regulatory or market changes

### 3.4 Risk and Compliance Reduction
- Lower operational risk from unsupported custom code
- Improved auditability and security posture
- Reduced risk of upgrade failures

### 3.5 Innovation Enablement
- Ability to adopt SAP BTP services
- Enablement of analytics, AI, and automation
- Future-proofing the SAP landscape

---

## 4. Baseline vs. Target State Logic

### Baseline (Current State)
Typical baseline characteristics include:
- High volume of custom objects
- Long upgrade cycles (measured in months)
- Manual regression testing
- Heavy reliance on system integrators
- Limited SAP innovation adoption

### Target State (Clean Core)
Target state characteristics include:
- Minimal core customizations
- Side-by-side extensions on supported platforms
- Predictable and shorter upgrade cycles
- Standardized processes
- Clear customization governance

## 5. Value Calculation Approach

Value is calculated by:

1. Identifying relevant value drivers
2. Establishing baseline metrics
3. Defining realistic target improvements
4. Calculating annualized economic impact
5. Applying conservative confidence assumptions

Typical calculation elements include:
- Labor hours avoided
- External spend reduction
- Downtime avoidance
- Cycle time reduction
- Risk-adjusted cost avoidance

All calculations should be transparent and finance-traceable.

---

## 6. Confidence and Sensitivity Considerations

Clean Core benefits are often:
- Gradual, not instantaneous
- Dependent on governance discipline
- Influenced by organizational maturity

Value assessments should:
- Start with conservative assumptions
- Use ranges rather than point estimates
- Be reviewed jointly with IT and Finance

---

## 7. Finance Validation Checklist

Before finalizing a Clean Core business case, confirm:

- Baseline data sources are validated
- Target assumptions are realistic
- One-time vs. recurring benefits are separated
- Investment costs are fully captured
- Benefits align with finance reporting structures

## 8. Disclaimer

This model provides **economic structure**, not guaranteed outcomes.
Actual value realization depends on execution quality, governance,
and sustained organizational discipline.
